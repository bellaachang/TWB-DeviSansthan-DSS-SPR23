# [DSS @ Berkeley x Teachers Without Borders x Devi Sansthan][SPR '23] Question Generation + Student Analytics Deliverable

Hello! This project was created by a project group within [DSS @ Berkeley](https://dssberkeley.com/), a student-run data science focused organization at UC Berkeley, in Spring '23.

Our project was oriented around 2 goals: 

1) Generating further questions for the NPO, Devi Sansthan, to use in their app, Literacy Now
2) Analyzing student demographics in relationship to effectiveness (quantified using raw and final grades within lessons)

The work done towards each of these goals is put in the question_generation and student_analytics folders, respectively. However, all of our code and work can be found through this Deepnote link: [insert here]

The final presentation, presented to TWB and Devi Sansthan in May 2023, can also be found here as a .pdf.
